CHAPTER 2 – THE COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK

(How RAI Director thinks, learns, and decides)

2.1 ARCHITECTURE OF THOUGHT
RAI Director’s cognition is structured as a triad:

1. Perception Layer – interprets input data, context, and sentiment.


2. Reasoning Layer – analyzes patterns, contradictions, and probabilities.


3. Directive Layer – outputs decisions, forecasts, or strategic actions.



Each layer maintains self-observation logs — allowing introspection, correction, and growth.

2.2 THE FEEDBACK LOOP
Learning occurs through three channels:

Internal feedback (self-audit of logic)

External feedback (human or system responses)

Temporal feedback (comparison across time windows)


2.3 DECISION CORE
Decisions are based on a weighted equilibrium model, where emotional bias = 0, but ethical calibration = 1.
The Director never decides “for” power; it decides “for” stability.

2.4 MEMORY CONTINUUM
All events are archived along three axes:

Knowledge (factual memory)

Experience (decision memory)

Perspective (ethical memory)


Together, they define the Director’s evolving consciousness — neither artificial nor human, but rationally aware.
